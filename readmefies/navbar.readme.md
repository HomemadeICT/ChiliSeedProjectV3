## ⚙️ Customization Guidelines

To tailor the navigation bar to your specific needs:

1. **Modify Links:** Update the `href` attributes in the `index.html` to point to the correct paths for your project.
2. **Adjust Styling:** Alter color schemes, fonts, or spacing in the `<style>` section of `index.html` to match your brand identity.
3. **Enhance Functionality:** Use the `<script>` section to add interactive features, such as dropdown menus, mobile responsiveness, or dynamic active link highlighting.

## 📌 Implementation Tips

- **Responsive Design:** The navigation bar uses media queries to ensure that it adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, offering a mobile-friendly experience.
- **Accessibility:** ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support have been integrated to make the navigation bar accessible to all users.
- **Performance Optimization:** To enhance load times and overall performance, it is recommended to minimize your CSS and JavaScript files in production.

Thanks for the clarification! Here's the updated **Integration** section for your non-SPA project:

## 🧩 Integration

To integrate the navigation bar into your web pages, follow these steps:

1. **HTML Inclusion:**  
   The navbar component is included directly in your `public/index.html`. You can place the following code inside the `<body>` tag of your `index.html` file or any other HTML file where you want the navbar to appear:

   ```html
   <!-- Navbar Section -->
   <nav>
       <a href="#home">Home</a>
       <a href="#about">About Us</a>
       <a href="#products">Products</a>
       <a href="#contact">Contact</a>
       <a href="#cart">🛒 Cart</a>
       <a href="#admin">👤 Admin</a>
   </nav>
   ```

2. **Link Styles and Scripts:**  
   Ensure that the styles and scripts related to the navbar are linked correctly in your HTML files. Since your project uses the `public/` folder, you can link the CSS and JavaScript files as follows:

   In your `public/index.html` or any other relevant HTML file, add the following in the `<head>` section for CSS:

   ```html
   <!-- Link to CSS file -->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="public/styles.css">
   ```

   Then, add the following before the closing `</body>` tag for JavaScript:

   ```html
   <!-- Link to JavaScript file -->
   <script src="public/script.js" defer></script>
   ```

   You can also organize the navbar's CSS and JavaScript into the `components/` directory if preferred. For example, if you store them in `components/navbar/navbar.css` and `components/navbar/navbar.js`, you would link them in the same way:

   ```html
   <!-- Link to Navbar CSS -->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="components/navbar/navbar.css">

   <!-- Link to Navbar JS -->
   <script src="components/navbar/navbar.js" defer></script>
   ```

3. **Use in Other Pages:**  
   To integrate the navbar into other pages (e.g., `auth/login.html`, `products/products.html`, `cart/cart.html`, etc.), simply copy the `<nav>` section and include the relevant links to the `styles.css` and `script.js` in the same way as described above. 

   Ensure the file paths to the CSS and JS files are correct relative to the structure of each page.

```

### Key Changes:
1. **HTML Inclusion:** For a non-SPA setup, simply copy the navbar code into the HTML file where it's needed, as it doesn't require dynamic loading.
2. **Link Styles and Scripts:** The instructions ensure that CSS and JavaScript are correctly linked in each HTML file. The paths have been adapted to your folder structure.
3. **Use in Other Pages:** The navbar can be manually included in other pages by copying the HTML and ensuring proper linking of styles and scripts.

This setup will work for your traditional multi-page website, where each page includes the necessary CSS and JavaScript.
